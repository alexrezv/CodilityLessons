/*
 * An array A consisting of N integers is given.
 * Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is
 * moved to the first place.
 *
 * For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and
 * 6 is moved to the first place).
 *
 * The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *     class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }
 * that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *     N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
 *     each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
 *
 * In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
